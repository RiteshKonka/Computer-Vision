# 1. Automatic License Plate Detection with YOLOv8 and EasyOCR

This project is an automatic license plate detection system built using state-of-the-art deep learning models, YOLOv8 and EasyOCR. The system is capable of detecting and reading license plates from a video stream. It leverages YOLOv8 for robust object detection, accurately identifying vehicles and their bounding boxes in real-time. The detected vehicles are then tracked using the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm, ensuring smooth tracking across frames.

Once the vehicles are tracked, the system utilizes EasyOCR to read the license plate numbers with impressive accuracy. The license plate information, along with the corresponding vehicle data, is extracted and saved in a CSV file for further analysis or processing
